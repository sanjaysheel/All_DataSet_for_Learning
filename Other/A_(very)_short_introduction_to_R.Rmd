### Description

This course is the swirl version of [A (very) short introduction to R](https://github.com/ClaudiaBrauer/A-very-short-introduction-to-R/blob/master/documents/A%20(very)%20short%20introduction%20to%20R.pdf). This document has 10 pages of background and exercises and 2 pages listing useful functions (to use as a reference). Working through this tutorial takes 1 to 2 hours (depending on your background). 

Instead of reading the pdf and doing the ToDo exercises, you can also go through the text and exercises interactively, using swirl. The contents are the same (with a few exceptions), so you can open the pdf version alongside to look up how to do something you learned before or browse through the references on the last two pages.

If you find any errors, please let me know on the [issues page](https://github.com/ClaudiaBrauer/A-very-short-introduction-to-R/issues).
